Divide study locations with rest locations.",Find a new spot that is open late. Unit 3 should be last resort. Use Safewalk to walk back home. Find meditation spot. Unit 3 should only be for rest.

It seems like a lot of these systems work under the constraint that I find a good study spot. And I get good enough rest. What normally would have been satiated through internet, is now replaced with social interaction. Interesting dynamic. Est. Time for socialization 3:30 mins","I need to work to find a strong balance between locking in, and resting once I come back. Wake up early, lock in for the whole day, come back at 9:30PM and rest."

Sleep should always be prioritized, you should remember what happened when you slept at 5:00AM last night lmao. Rest up big kid. You're doing great. Consistency, discipline. ",Maybe not the best idea to study with friends for tasks that require high cognitive load. Cafe study isn't the best idea. Try going to the library more.
