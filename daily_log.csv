Divide study locations with rest locations.",Find a new spot that is open late. Unit 3 should be last resort. Use Safewalk to walk back home. Find meditation spot. Unit 3 should only be for rest.

It seems like a lot of these systems work under the constraint that I find a good study spot. And I get good enough rest. What normally would have been satiated through internet, is now replaced with social interaction. Interesting dynamic. Est. Time for socialization 3:30 mins","I need to work to find a strong balance between locking in, and resting once I come back. Wake up early, lock in for the whole day, come back at 9:30PM and rest."
